# langtonsAnt-processing
[Langton's Ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant) implemented in [processing](https://processing.org/). Coded at Processing Community Day (09.02.2019 @ HeK Basel). To start just run the scetch "langtonsAnt.pde". User can input some parameters:
- nbrOfCols -> determines the nbr of cells on the x-axis
- nbrOfRows -> determines the nbr of cells on the y-axis
- pxPerCell -> how big is each cell (min value allowed is 2).
- renderSpeed -> set between 1 and 5000
these inputs determine the size of the window. If the windowsize is higher than your screensize the algorithm will not start and a message is displayed to the console. Have fun!
